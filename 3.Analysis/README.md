This report provides an overview of the data cleaning phase and data analysis phase for the Stack Overflow Survey Analysis project. The aim is to ensure transparency and clarity, particularly for those unfamiliar with the project's objectives and methodologies.

## Background and Dataset Selection
The Stack Overflow Survey is a widely recognized dataset within the tech community, offering insights into developers' preferences, trends, and behaviors. Our project focuses on analyzing this dataset to gain valuable insights into the global developer community.

The dataset, available at [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/), was selected for its extensive coverage of developer-related topics and its relevance to our research objectives. With data spanning multiple years and encompassing a diverse range of developer demographics and preferences, it serves as a rich source for our analysis.

## Project Size Considerations
Given the extensive nature of the Stack Overflow Survey dataset, we structured our analysis into three separate folders, each dedicated to a specific analyst's contributions:

- **Joshua_Analysis**
- **Mustafa_Analysis**
- **Negin_Analysis**

Each folder contains in-depth analyses conducted by our team, focusing on different aspects of the dataset. By dividing the analysis among team members, we aimed to distribute workload efficiently and ensure thorough coverage of the research questions.
Within each analysis folder, you'll find detailed insights, visualizations, and interpretations aimed at addressing specific questions outlined in the main README file. This collaborative approach allowed us to leverage individual expertise while maintaining a cohesive framework for the project.
