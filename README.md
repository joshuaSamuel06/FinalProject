# ELO MIT Emerging Talent Project
## Tech Trends:Unveiling the Developer Landscape
### Overview

Our project analyzes data from Stack Overflow's 2023 survey to visualize tech industry trends, addressing the uncertainties faced by newcomers regarding skills and programming languages amidst the rapid evolution and rise of AI.


### Problem Statement
The tech industry is evolving rapidly, often leaving newcomers uncertain about which skills and programming languages to learn to stay current in the market. The rise of AI has added to these uncertainties, prompting many questions for those entering the field. Many wish they had a group of experienced tech professionals to consult for guidance.


### Research questions:

1. Which tools, frameworks, and programming languages are most prevalent in the tech industry?
2. Which roles in the tech industry offer the highest salaries?
3. What are current tech professionals' opinions on the newly introduced AI tools in the market?

### Objective:

Our project aims to conduct a deep exploratory analysis of the data from Stack Overflow's 2023 survey. We will provide visual representations of this data to help both prospective and current tech industry professionals understand market trends and needs.

### Data Collection

### Non-Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling
- **Approach:** Our data modeling approach involves incorporating a multidimensional analysis of migration patterns in post-conflict regions. We consider key factors such as socio-economic conditions, conflict dynamics, and demographic shifts. The choice is influenced by insights from domain experts, emphasizing both quantitative and qualitative data to capture the complexity of migration.

- **Possible Flaws:** While our approach is comprehensive, potential flaws may include challenges in quantifying certain qualitative aspects. Additionally, biases in available data sources could impact the accuracy of our models, given that we could only find the dataset limited to Europe as a destination continent.



### Data Cleaning
During the data cleaning phase, we created three distinct processed datasets from the original data to meet the requirements of our analysis, focusing on different variables. The original dataset, derived from a survey, contained many null values due to optional questions. To address this, we developed three separate datasets, each without null values for the key variables

- **Description:** This folder contains the files that includes the original MIMI dataset, cleaned versions, and additional data on countries of interest. The structure is documented in the cleaning.ipynb file, outlining the transformation process. Possible flaws, such as missing or incomplete data, are acknowledged.
