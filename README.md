### Problem Statement:

The rapid pace of technological advancements and the ever-evolving nature of the tech industry present challenges for professionals, students, and industry enthusiasts to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and navigate the dynamic landscape effectively. While there is a wealth of information available, there is a need for a comprehensive project that synthesizes and provides valuable insights into various aspects of the tech industry, including popular tools and programming languages, global developer distribution, education levels, database environments, common frameworks and languages, high-paying skills, AI tool usage, remote work preferences, career paths, and the trust in AI tools. Furthermore, there is a lack of consolidated and up-to-date data that sheds light on these aspects, hindering individuals' ability to make informed decisions and adapt to the rapidly changing industry. Therefore, the problem at hand is to address the aforementioned knowledge gap by conducting thorough research, analyzing survey data, studying market trends, and conducting interviews to create a comprehensive project titled "Tech Trends: Unveiling the Developer Landscape" that equips professionals, students, and industry enthusiasts with the necessary knowledge and confidence to navigate the dynamic tech landscape successfully.

### Research questions:

1. What are the most used tools in the tech industry, and which frameworks, languages, and tools are commonly used by developers?
2. In which top 5 countries do most developers who answered the survey reside, and how does remote work preference vary across different age groups, countries, and industries among developers?
3. What education level do most developers have, which programming, scripting, and markup languages are commonly used in program development, and how does annual compensation vary with different levels of work experience and the choice of tools/languages?
