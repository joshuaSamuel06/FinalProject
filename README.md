### Data Cleaning
During the data cleaning phase, we created three distinct processed datasets from the original data to meet the requirements of our analysis, focusing on different variables. The original dataset, derived from a survey, contained many null values due to optional questions. To address this, we developed three separate datasets, each without null values for the key variables
