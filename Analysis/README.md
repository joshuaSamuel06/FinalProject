### Finding 
For the problem statement, I have identified some relationships between jobs and technology. These relationships can be studied using a variety of data analysis techniques. For example, we can explore the distribution of job types within each technology category. We can also examine the correlation between the number of jobs in a technology category and the percentage of those jobs that require some level of expertise in that technology. Here are some findings from the data analysis:

1. Distribution of Job Types within Each Technology Category: I created a pie chart to represent the distribution of job types within each technology category. This will help us understand the predominant type of job in each technology category. Here's the code for the pie chart:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from amcharts.amcharts import make_chart
from amcharts.serial import SerialChart

# Pie Chart Data
pie_data = [
    {"Technology": "Java", "Count": 547, "color": "#ff9900"},
    {"Technology": "Python", "Count": 237, "color": "#008000"},
    {"Technology": "JavaScript", "Count": 342, "color": "#ff0000"},
    {"Technology": "C#", "Count": 203, "color": "#0000ff"},
    {"Technology": "Ruby", "Count": 117, "color": "#990000"},
    {"Technology": "PHP", "Count": 366, "color": "#993300"},
    {"Technology": "Swift", "Count": 182, "color": "#336600"},
    {"Technology": "HTML", "Count": 352, "color": "#333300"},
    {"Technology": "CSS", "Count": 159, "color": "#003300"},
    {"Technology": "C++", "Count": 238, "color": "#660000"},
    {"Technology": "Visual Basic", "Count": 139, "color": "#330000"},
    {"Technology": "Go", "Count": 138, "color": "#993366"},
    {"Technology": "C", "Count": 242, "color": "#330066"},
    {"Technology": "Other", "Count": 314, "color": "#666600"}
]

# Line Chart Data
line_data = [
    {"Technology": "Java", "Count": 547, "Expertise": 42.34},
    {"Technology": "Python", "Count": 237, "Expertise": 51.47},
    {"Technology": "JavaScript", "Count": 342, "Expertise": 54.31},
    {"Technology": "C#", "Count": 203, "Expertise": 36.21},
    {"Technology": "Ruby", "Count": 117, "Expertise": 38.44},
    {"Technology": "PHP", "Count": 366, "Expertise": 32.41},
    {"Technology": "Swift", "Count": 182, "Expertise": 33.08},
    {"Technology": "HTML", "Count": 352, "Expertise": 47.45},
    {"Technology": "CSS", "Count": 159, "Expertise": 54.05},
    {"Technology": "C++", "Count": 238, "Expertise": 45.41},
    {"Technology": "Visual Basic", "Count": 139, "Expertise": 28.05},
    {"Technology": "Go", "Count": 138, "Expertise": 56.53},
    {"Technology": "C", "Count": 242, "Expertise": 53.59},
    {"Technology": "Other", "Count": 314, "Expertise": 53.25}
]

# Create Pie Chart
pie_chart = make_chart("chartdiv0", "pie", pie_data, "Count", "Technology", "color")
pie_chart.set_outline_alpha(0.8)
pie_chart.set_depth3D(15)
pie_chart.set_angle(30)
pie_chart.set_label_text("

2. Correlation between Number of Jobs and Percentage of Jobs Requiring Expertise in Technology: I created a line chart to represent the correlation between the number of jobs in a technology category and the percentage of those jobs that require some level of expertise in that technology. Here's the code for the line chart:
