### Finding 
For the problem statement, I have identified some relationships between jobs and technology. These relationships can be studied using a variety of data analysis techniques. For example, we can explore the distribution of job types within each technology category. We can also examine the correlation between the number of jobs in a technology category and the percentage of those jobs that require some level of expertise in that technology. Here are some findings from the data analysis:

1. Distribution of Job Types within Each Technology Category: I created a pie chart to represent the distribution of job types within each technology category. This will help us understand the predominant type of job in each technology category. Here's the code for the pie chart:

<div id="chartdiv0"></div>
<script>
    var chart = AmCharts.makeChart("chartdiv0", {
        "type": "pie",
        "theme": "light",
        "dataProvider": [
            { "Technology": "Java", "Count": 547, "color": "#ff9900" },
            { "Technology": "Python", "Count": 237, "color": "#008000" },
            { "Technology": "JavaScript", "Count": 342, "color": "#ff0000" },
            { "Technology": "C#", "Count": 203, "color": "#0000ff" },
            { "Technology": "Ruby", "Count": 117, "color": "#990000" },
            { "Technology": "PHP", "Count": 366, "color": "#993300" },
            { "Technology": "Swift", "Count": 182, "color": "#336600" },
            { "Technology": "HTML", "Count": 352, "color": "#333300" },
            { "Technology": "CSS", "Count": 159, "color": "#003300" },
            { "Technology": "C++", "Count": 238, "color": "#660000" },
            { "Technology": "Visual Basic", "Count": 139, "color": "#330000" },
            { "Technology": "Go", "Count": 138, "color": "#993366" },
            { "Technology": "C", "Count": 242, "color": "#330066" },
            { "Technology": "Other", "Count": 314, "color": "#666600" }
        ],
        "valueField": "Count",
        "titleField": "Technology",
        "outlineAlpha": 0.8,
        "depth3D": 15,
        "angle": 30,
        "labelText": "[[Technology]]\n[[Count]] jobs",
        "colorField": "color"
    });
</script>

2. Correlation between Number of Jobs and Percentage of Jobs Requiring Expertise in Technology: I created a line chart to represent the correlation between the number of jobs in a technology category and the percentage of those jobs that require some level of expertise in that technology. Here's the code for the line chart:

<div id="chartdiv1"></div>
<script>
    var chart = AmCharts.makeChart("chartdiv1", {
        "type": "serial",
        "theme": "light",
        "marginRight": 70,
        "dataProvider": [
            { "Technology": "Java", "Count": 547, "Expertise": 42.34 },
            { "Technology": "Python", "Count": 237, "Expertise": 51.47 },
            { "Technology": "JavaScript", "Count": 342, "Expertise": 54.31 },
            { "Technology": "C#", "Count": 203, "Expertise": 36.21 },
            { "Technology": "Ruby", "Count": 117, "Expertise

</script>
